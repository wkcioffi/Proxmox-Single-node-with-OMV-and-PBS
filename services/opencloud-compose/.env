## Basic Settings ##
# Define the docker compose log driver used.
# Defaults to local
LOG_DRIVER=
# If you're on an internet facing server, comment out following line.
# It skips certificate validation for various parts of OpenCloud and is
# needed when self signed certificates are used.
INSECURE=true

## Features ##
# The following variable is a convenience variable to enable or disable features of this compose project.
# Example: if you want to use traefik and letsencrypt, you can set the variable to
#COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:traefik/opencloud.yml
# This enables you to just run `docker compose up -d` and the compose files will be added to the stack.
# As alternative approach you can run `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d`
# Default: OpenCloud and Collabora with traefik and letsencypt
# This needs DNS entries for the domain names used in the .env file.
#COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:weboffice/collabora.yml:traefik/opencloud.yml:traefik/collabora.yml
# If you want to use the external proxy, you can use the following combination.
# DNS entries and certificates need to be managed by the external environment.
# The domain names need to be entered into the .env file.
#COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:weboffice/collabora.yml:external-proxy/opencloud.yml:external-proxy/collabora.yml
# Keycloak Shared User Directory
#COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:weboffice/collabora.yml:traefik/opencloud.yml:traefik/collabora.yml:idm/ldap-keycloak.yml:traefik/ldap-keycloak.yml
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:external-proxy/opencloud-exposed.yml

# echo $(htpasswd -nB user) | sed -e s/\\$/\\$\\$/g
TRAEFIK_BASIC_AUTH_USERS=
# Email address for obtaining LetsEncrypt certificates.
# Needs only be changed if this is a public facing server.
TRAEFIK_ACME_MAIL=
# Set to the following for testing to check the certificate process:
# "https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
# With staging configured, there will be an SSL error in the browser.
# When certificates are displayed and are emitted by # "Fake LE Intermediate X1",
# the process went well and the envvar can be reset to empty to get valid certificates.
TRAEFIK_ACME_CASERVER=
# Enable the Traefik ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment) for automatic SSL certificate management.
TRAEFIK_SERVICES_TLS_CONFIG="tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
# Enable Traefik to use local certificates.
#TRAEFIK_SERVICES_TLS_CONFIG="tls=true"
# You also need to provide a config file in ./config/traefik/dynamic/certs.yml
# Example:
# cat ./config/traefik/dynamic/certs.yml
# tls:
#   certificates:
#     - certFile: /certs/opencloud.test.crt
#       keyFile: /certs/opencloud.test.key

#       defaultCertificate:
#         certFile: /certs/opencloud.test.crt
#         keyFile: /certs/opencloud.test.key
#
# The certificates need to be copied into ./certs/, the absolute path inside the container is /certs/.
# You can also use TRAEFIK_CERTS_DIR=/path/on/host to set the path to the certificates directory.
# Enable the access log for Traefik by setting the following variable to true.
TRAEFIK_ACCESS_LOG=
# Configure the log level for Traefik.

START_ADDITIONAL_SERVICES=""


## Default Enabled Services ##

### Apache Tika Content Analysis Toolkit ###
# Tika (search) is disabled by default due to performance reasons.
# Tika is used to extract metadata and text from various file formats.
# Enable it by adding the following to the COMPOSE_FILE variable:
# search/tika.yml or by using the following command:
# docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f search/tika.yml up -d
# Set the desired docker image tag or digest.
# Defaults to "apache/tika:latest"
# The slim variant is recommended for most use cases as it provides core text extraction
# functionality with a smaller image size and faster startup time.
# Only use the full variant (apache/tika:latest-full) if you need specialized features
# like advanced OCR or specific image processing capabilities.
TIKA_IMAGE=

### IMPORTANT Note for Online Office Apps ###
# To avoid app interlocking issues, you should select only one app to be active/configured.
# This is due the fact that there is currently no app interlocking for the same file and one
# has to wait for a lock release to open the file with another app.

### Collabora Settings ###
# Domain of Collabora, where you can find the frontend.
# Defaults to "collabora.opencloud.test"
COLLABORA_DOMAIN=
# Domain of the wopiserver which handles Collabora.
# Defaults to "wopiserver.opencloud.test"

# If you're on an internet-facing server, enable SSL verification for Collabora Online.
# Please comment out the following line:
COLLABORA_SSL_VERIFICATION=false
# Enable home mode in Collabore Online.
# Home users can enable this setting, which in turn disables welcome screen and user feedback popups,
# but also limits concurrent open connections to 20 and concurrent open documents to 10.
# Default is false if not specified.
COLLABORA_HOME_MODE=


### Virusscanner Settings ###
# IMPORTANT: If you enable antivirus, you also MUST configure the START_ADDITIONAL_SERVICES
# envvar in the OpenCloud Settings above by adding 'antivirus' to the list.
# The maximum scan size the virus scanner can handle, needs adjustment in the scanner config as well:
# For ClamAV, set CLAMD_CONF_StreamMaxLength in antivirus/clamav.yml to the same or a higher value.
# Usable common abbreviations: [KB, KiB, MB, MiB, GB, GiB, TB, TiB, PB, PiB, EB, EiB], example: 2GB.

INBUCKET_DOMAIN=


### Compose Configuration ###
# Path separator for supplemental compose files specified in COMPOSE_FILE.
COMPOSE_PATH_SEPARATOR=:

### Ldap Settings ###
# LDAP is always needed for OpenCloud to store user data as there is no relational database.
# The built-in LDAP server should used for testing purposes or small installations only.
# For production installations, it is recommended to use an external LDAP server.
# We are using OpenLDAP as the default LDAP server because it is proven to be stable and reliable.
# This LDAP configuration is known to work with OpenCloud and provides a blueprint for
# configuring an external LDAP server based on other products like Microsoft Active Directory or other LDAP servers.
#
# Password of LDAP bind user "cn=admin,dc=opencloud,dc=eu". Defaults to "admin"
LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD=
# The LDAP server also creates an openCloud admin user dn: uid=admin,ou=users,dc=opencloud,dc=eu
# The initial password for this user is "admin"
# NOTE: This password can only be set once, if you want to change it later, you have to use the OpenCloud User Settings UI.
# If you changed the password and lost it, you need to execute the following LDAP query to reset it:
# enter the ldap-server container with `docker compose exec ldap-server sh`
# and run the following command to change the password:
# ldappasswd -H ldap://127.0.0.1:1389 -D "cn=admin,dc=opencloud,dc=eu" -W "uid=admin,ou=users,dc=opencloud,dc=eu"
# You will be prompted for the LDAP bind password.
# The output should provide you a new password for the admin user.


### Keycloak Settings ###
# Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution.
# We are using Keycloak as the default identity provider on production installations.
# It can be used to federate authentication with other identity providers like
# Microsoft Entra ID, ADFS or other SAML/OIDC providers.
# The use of Keycloak as bridge between OpenCloud and other identity providers creates more control over the
# authentication process, the allowed clients and the session management.
# Keycloak also manages the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for OpenCloud.
# Keycloak can be used in two different modes:
# 1. Autoprovisioning: New users are automatically created in openCloud when they log in for the first time.
# 2. Shared User Directory: Users are created in Keycloak and can be used in OpenCloud immediately
# because the LDAP server is connected to both Keycloak and OpenCloud.
# Only use one of the two modes at a time.

## Autoprovisioning Mode ##
# Use together with idm/external-idp.yml
# If you want to use a keycloak for local testing, you can use testing/external-keycloak.yml and testing/ldap-manager.yml
# Domain of your Identity Provider.
IDP_DOMAIN=
# IdP Issuer URL, which is used to identify the Identity Provider.
# We need the complete URL, including the protocol (http or https) and the realm.
# Example: "https://keycloak.opencloud.test/realms/openCloud"
IDP_ISSUER_URL=
# Url of the account edit page from your Identity Provider.
IDP_ACCOUNT_URL=

## Shared User Directory Mode ##
# Use together with idm/ldap-keycloak.yml and traefik/ldap-keycloak.yml
# Domain for Keycloak. Defaults to "keycloak.opencloud.test".
KEYCLOAK_DOMAIN=
# Admin user login name. Defaults to "kcadmin".
KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=
# Admin user login password. Defaults to "admin".
KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=
# Keycloak Database username. Defaults to "keycloak".
KC_DB_USERNAME=
# Keycloak Database password. Defaults to "keycloak".
KC_DB_PASSWORD=

### Radicale Setting ###
# Radicale is a small open-source CalDAV (calendars, to-do lists) and CardDAV (contacts) server.
# When enabled OpenCloud is configured as a reverse proxy for Radicale, providing all authenticated
# OpenCloud users access to a Personal Calendar and Addressbook
# Docker image to use for the Radicale Container
#RADICALE_DOCKER_IMAGE=opencloudeu/radicale
# Docker tag to pull for the Radicale Container
#RADICALE_DOCKER_TAG=latest
# Define the storage location for the Radicale data. Set the path to a local path.
# Ensure that the configuration and data directories are owned by the user and group with ID 1000:1000.
# This matches the default user inside the container and avoids permission issues when accessing files.
# Leaving it default stores data in docker internal volumes.
#RADICALE_DATA_DIR=/your/local/radicale/data
